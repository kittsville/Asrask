# Asrask

Askrask is the front-end of Raofu, the Reddit brigading detection system. Asrask lets Reddit's moderators find out who is brigading which threads.

Askrask uses [Rendant's](https://github.com/kittsville/Randant) REST API to request analysis of threads and fetch results. Raofu is based on the Reddit brigading detection system described in Maywood (2017).
