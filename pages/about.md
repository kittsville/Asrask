Raofu is a brigading detection tool. It can identify which users are disrupting a Reddit submission's comments. Raofu assists moderators in managing brigaded threads so they don't have to resort to extreme measures such as locking the thread.

Raofu is based on a thesis that proposed and implemented a prototype brigading detection tool. The evaluation of that prototype identified several ways to improve the tool's accuracy. Raofu implements those improvements as well as distributing the tool's architecture for maximum performance.

When Raofu enters private beta you will be able to apply to use the tool.
