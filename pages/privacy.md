This page explains what data Raofu stores, who has access to it and how you can delete your data. Updates to the Privacy Policy will be made along with [Terms of Service](/terms/) updates.

### Data stored by Raofu

- Applications to use Raofu
- Moderators of every subreddit authorised to use Raofu
- Requests to analyse threads
- Results of every thread analysis:
	- Username of every suspected user
	- Link to every suspected user's comment in the thread
	- The proportion of their participation in the brigading and brigaded communities
- A cache of the proportion of users' participation in subreddits (e.g. `kittsville 0.347 /r/pics`)

### Ownership of Data

All data created using Raofu is owned by Raofu's administrators. I'll change this to users owning the data they create as soon as someone tells me a way to properly word it. I'd rather people owned the data they create but that could end up screwing me over unless I put in the right "allow Raofu admins to do X and Y with data" disclaimers. Please [open an issue](https://github.com/kittsville/asrask/issues/new) or drop me a line on Twitter ([@kittsville](https://twitter.com/kittsville)) if you know how to write a good Privacy Policy!

### Access to data

- You have access to the results of your own analyses*
- You can give other access to results you create*
- Administrators of Raofu (e.g. /u/kittsville) have access to all results

*Provided your account isn't terminated for violating the [Terms of Service](/terms/).

### Deleting your data

- You can delete your account
- All analyses created by your account are deleted as well
- Caches generated as a result of an analysis you ran are not deleted when you delete your account
