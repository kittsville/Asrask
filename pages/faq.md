---

The questions have been categorised according to whether users of Reddit, moderators or researchers might ask the question.

### Users

#### Q. Why am I banned from $subname?

No idea. You will need to ask the moderators of $subname.

#### Q. Can you unban me?

No, because I didn't ban you\*. Raofu is a tool used by Reddit's moderators to identify the most suspicious users. If you're banned from a subreddit it's because that sub's moderators banned you. There's nothing I can do to change that.

\*Unless I happen to moderate that subreddit.

#### Q. Can I use Raofu?

Unfortunately not. Owing to its potential to be misused, Raofu is only available to moderators and researchers.

#### Q. Why didn't Raofu identify a brigading user?

Raofu isn't perfect and can both misidentify users and fail to identify brigading users. Brigading is understudied making it hard to improve Raofu's accuracy or objectively verify its performance. If you have any thoughts on how to improve Raofu then drop by [/r/Raofu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Raofu/).

Raofu doesn't have the capacity to ban users. Moderators have to manually inspect the users Raofu identifies before making any moderation decisions.

#### Q. Are you an SJW?

Maybe? I don't know. I've been called both an SJW *and* and Nazi for equally stupid reasons.

#### Q. Would you rather fight 100 duck-sized horses or 1 horse-sized duck?

Definitely the 100 duck-sized horses. Ducks are creepy little rapists so a horse-sized one would be terrifying.

### Moderators

#### Q. Can I use Raofu?

Eventually. Raofu is currently in pre-Alpha (very early release) and has a lot of kinks that need ironing out. When Raofu becomes more stable it'll be made available on a per-subreddit basis.

#### Q. Which subreddits and why?

As [mentioned above](#q-can-i-use-raofu), Raofu is not open to everyone as it could be misused to harass users from specific subreddits.

If anyone who was a moderator could use Raofu then people would just create a blank subreddit to bypass the check. Enforcing a minimum subscriber limit wouldn't stop people being modded to one of those anyone-can-be-a-mod subs. Regardless, there are popular subreddits whose moderators would have no qualms with misusing Raofu. Requiring subreddits to apply for access helps limit misuse. I'm not having Raofu become another piece of garbage on the internet that just makes the problems it tries to solve worse.

#### Q. Can I share Raofu's results?

Yes. A result can be accessed if you know its URL. This is the same as YouTube's unlisted videos or Imgur's hidden albums. Misusing this feature to target harassment at detected users will result in you and your subreddit\* being permanently banned from Raofu.

In time, a permissions system will likely be implemented based on feedback from moderators.

\* And any connected subreddits e.g. /r/Foo and /r/FooDiscussion

#### Q. Someone is misusing Raofu. Who do I tell?

Either [PM /r/Raofu's moderators](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=/r/Raofu), [email me directly](mailto:kittsville@gmail.com?subject=Raofu Abuse) or [open an issue](https://github.com/kittsville/Raofu/issues/new) on GitHub.

#### Q. Raofu isn't working. What do?

Please [open an issue](https://github.com/kittsville/Raofu/issues/new) on GitHub describing what the bug is and how to replicate it.

#### Q. Can you add a feature?

Possibly, yes. [Open an issue](https://github.com/kittsville/Raofu/issues/new) on GitHub or submit a new thread on [/r/Raofu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Raofu/) describing what it is you want implemented and why it would be useful. I work on Raofu in my spare time, so there's no guarantee it will be implemented, but I'll certainly take any suggestions into account.

#### Q. Raofu is down, what do?

Raofu is taken down briefly for updates and bug-fixes every Wednesday. Maintenance should be announced on [/r/Raofu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Raofu/) beforehand. Raofu might occasionally be down during the rest of the week for emergency maintenance.

There's always the chance Raofu is down because of an external attack or some other issue. Check [/r/Raofu](https://www.reddit.com/r/Raofu/) to see if anything has been announced and [email me](mailto:kittsville@gmail.com?subject=Raofu is Down) if there's nothing on the sub.

### Researchers

#### Q. Can I use Raofu?

Yes, eventually. The needs of moderators and researchers are very different. Development is initially targeted at implementing the core features that moderators want. In time a feature set will be added which allows researchers to use the Raofu engine to analyse Reddit and its communities. There is even the possibility of testing your own custom brigading detection algorithm using Raofu.

#### Q. How does Raofu work?
